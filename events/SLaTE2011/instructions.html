    <h2> Speaker instructions </h2>
    <p>
Oral presentations will last 25 minutes (20 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for discussion and speaker swap).
Since we must strictly follow the program schedule, the session chairs will enforce the start and stop time of your talk.
Please show up in the lecture hall 10 minutes prior to the start of your session. </p>
    <h3>AV equipment</h3>
    <p>A data projector will be provided in the lecture hall. You may use your own laptop in your presentation, so long as it has a VGA port.
Note that since the data projector is NOT equipped with switched multiple ports, you will need to manually connect it before the start of your talk.
Alternatively, we will make available an Intel-based laptop with an (Italian) version of Microsoft PowerPoint '97, which will be connected to the projector.</p>

<h3>Poster session</h3>
<p>If you are presenting a poster in one of the poster sessions, you will need to prepare the material you would like to display.
Each poster will be allocated a frame 100cm wide by 150cm high in which to display your poster or paper sheets. Your poster should display at the top the title of your paper as well as the name(s) and affiliation(s) of the author(s). Please ensure easy reading at a distance.
Posters will be mounted on a velvet-covered piece of wood. We will provide the necessary materials to affix your poster to this mouting. Note, however, that there will be no facilities available for copying, magnifying or doing any process whatsoever with originals.
Though you will be expected to stand by your poster site in the poster area only during the poster session in which you poster has been included.
As a result, please plan to set up your poster as soon as you arrive, the day your presentation is planned, and to remove it after the session. Consult with one of the organizers when you arrive to find out where you should set up. </p>
